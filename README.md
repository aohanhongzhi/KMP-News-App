# 💎 Compose Multiplatform - News App


# Application Scope
This is a simple application that presents news information. The data is dynamically sourced from the [News Api](https://newsapi.org/).

🗡️ This demonstrates modern Android development with Hilt, Coroutines, Flow, Jetpack (Room, ViewModel), and Material Design based on MVVM architecture.

The app has a few screens located in multiple feature modules:

- News list screen - displays list of News
- News detail screen - display information about the selected news item
- Favourites screen - display list of news item which are stored in local app database
- Profile screen - empty (WiP)
